    <p>It's not always easy to know when you should refer a patient, especially with something as complex as endodontics. We usually recommend referral of patients who fall under complexity codes 2 and 3 based on the Restorative Index of Treatment Need (RIOTN) (FDS RCS Eng)</p>

        Some modifying factors can also increase the need for referral, including endodontic retreatment, difficult access and the patientâ€™s medical history. If you are unsure about whether to refer, we are happy to advise you either by phone or email.
